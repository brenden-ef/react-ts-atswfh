## Congratulations! Your startup has been awarded with some investment to try your hand at rebuilding Twitter.

Let's work on building this together. In the time alotted, please try and accomplish the following goals with your pairing partner:

1. Fetch all tweets from the API (the urls is provided in `data.ts`) and display them on a page.
2. Create a feature that will allow a user to post a tweet (don't worry about authenticaiton and assume that you will only have to deal with one user on the page).
3. Create well styled components while accomplishing both points above.

## ⚡Stretch Goals⚡

If you can accomplish these as well, we'll be really impressed.

- Allow a user to delete a tweet
- Allow a user to edit a tweet
- Allow a user to retweet a tweet.

You an use any tools or libraries you'd like, but please do use React. If you have questions, consider your EF companion your stakeholder for this challenge.
